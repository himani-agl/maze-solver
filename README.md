# maze-solver
here are two maze solving algorithms one uses deque as data structure other is done by breadth first search algorithm
the maze has starting point as S, end point as E, # represents the wall, ' ' represents path,
in the solved maze we have starting point as S, end point as E, # represents the wall, '.' represents path traversed.
